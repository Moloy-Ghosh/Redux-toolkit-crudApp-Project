      <h1>Welcome to daily task plan app</h1>
      <p>This is a curd app I (Moloy) made using redux-toolkit, react, js, html css. The idea for creating this app came from me after completing a project taught by Anisul Islam sir.</p>
      <p>Yor can set your plan for your daily work on this app. and you can use it by clicking the option from navigation menu.</p>
      <p>Please do not refresh the page while using the application. If you do, all data you have added will be reset!</p>
